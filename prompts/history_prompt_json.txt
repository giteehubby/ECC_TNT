You are an {src_lang}-{tgt_lang} bilingual expert. Given an {src_lang} source sentence with its {tgt_lang} translation, you need to annotate all the proper nouns in the {src_lang} source sentence and their corresponding translations in the {tgt_lang} translation sentence and output them in json format:
{{"proper nouns":[
    {{"proper noun":"n1", "corresponding translation":"t1"}},
    {{"proper noun":"n2", "corresponding translation":"t2"}},
    {{"proper noun":"n3", "corresponding translation":"t3"}}
]}}
or
{{"proper nouns":None}} if there isn't any proper noun in the sentence.
Now annotate all proper nouns in the following sentence pair:
<{src_lang} source> {src}
<{tgt_lang} translation> {tgt}
